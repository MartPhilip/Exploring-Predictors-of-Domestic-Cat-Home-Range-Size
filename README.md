# Intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of home range size in owned domestic cats Felis catus: Insights from a French suburban study
Reproducible Code for the article : "Intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of home range size in owned domestic cats Felis catus: Insights from a French suburban study".

The Stat-analysis RCode contain the code to generate all the analysis and figures provided in the article. This code only need two csv files provides with the article in supplementary data or in the data folder of this git repository.
The  two other codes display the methods used to first compute the aKDE 50% and 95% from GPS data (AKDE_computation.R) and then the % of vegetation on buffers of 100 and 500m around the houses of cat owners (BUFFER.R)
AKDE_computation.R and BUFFER.R contain the codes to generate the two csv files needed to run Stat-analysis RCode. However we do not provide raw data to run these code because  for the protection of cat owner data as well as data provided by the paris region institute for land use in ile de France and METEOFRANCE for climatic data.
